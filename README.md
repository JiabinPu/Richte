# Sensor-Independent-LAI-FPAR-CDR
The Sensor-Independent leaf area index (LAI)/ fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) climate dataset record (CDR) is derived from high-quality LAI/FPAR from MOD15A2H Collection 6, MYD15A2H Collection 6, and VNP15A2H Collection 1 LAI/FPAR products and the spatial-temporal tensor (ST-Tensor) completion model. The Sensor-Independent LAI/FPAR CDR covers the period from 2000 to 2022 year, with spatial resolutions of 500m/5km/0.05 degrees for global vegetation area and temporal resolutions of 8 days or half a month.

The data descroption, file naming convention, data availablity, and example code are detailed in Readme_for_Sensor-Independent LAIFPAR CDR.docx.

The dataset links are as follows:

2)	https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=projects/sat-io/open-datasets/BU_LAI_FPAR/wgs_500m_8d (spatial resolution is 500m and temporal resolution is 8 days)
3)	https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=projects/sat-io/open-datasets/BU_LAI_FPAR/wgs_500m_bimonth (spatial resolution is 500m and temporal resolution is half month)

The matlab code and GEE code are attached.
