1. DATA DESCRIPTION
The Sensor-Independent LAI/FPAR climate dataset record (CDR) is derived from high quality LAI/FPAR from MOD15AH C6, MYD15A2H C6, and VNP15A2H C1 products. The low-quality LAI/FPARs were first removed by quality control method and the high-quality LAI/FPARs were merged into Filtered Sensor-Independent LAI/FPAR data. The missing values are then gap filled by spatial-temporal tensor (ST-Tensor) completion model. The Sensor-Independent LAI/FPAR CDR is produced based on different projections and spatial/temporal resolutions. The characteristic of the Sensor-Independent LAI/FPAR CDR can be found in Table 1.
